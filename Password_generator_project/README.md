# Password Generator

A secure and customizable password generator desktop application developed using Python and Tkinter. It was my personal project which I did during my college time to learn GUI development, file handling, and secure password generation techniques.

The goal of the project is to generate strong, medium, or weak passwords, check their strength, save them for future use, and provide easy copy-to-clipboard functionality through a simple GUI.
